# Linux

## Part 1

- An OS is a collection of software that manages hardware resources and provides an environment where applications run. 
- For example, the OS allows applications to store information, send documents to printers, interact with users.

## Linux OS = Linux Distribution (aka Distro or Flavor)

- **A Linux distribution is a collection of software applications bundled together and distributed as a single operating system + Linux kernel.**
- For example, one Linux distribution might come with one particular web browser installed, while another Linux distribution will come with another web browser installed by default. 
- **Think of a Linux distribution as a curated collection of software** that works well together, but you're more than welcome to user the software and applications that you like best.  
- There are literally hundreds of Linux distros.

## Linux Kernel

- However, what every Linux distro has in common is the Linux Kernel. 
- The `Linux Kernel` is the core, or the heart of the OS. It's the layer that sits between the hardware and applications. In other words, it's the intermediary between software and hardware.  
- **Linux Kernel + Apps = Distro**
- In addition to the Kernel, you need system libraries, GUI, user interfaces, web browsers, email utilities, and other programs to have a useful OS.  
- A Linux distro is the Linux Kernel, and a collection of software that create an OS.

## The two most popular Linux Distros 
- RHEL (RedHat Enterprise Linux) and `Ubuntu` is the most popular Linux distro used in IT departments and professionals. 
- `RedHat Enterprise` requires a paid license, so instead, use `CentOS`, which is a `RedHat Enterprise Linux` derivative that's completely free. It's really RedHat with the branding and logo replaced with CentOS branding. 
- `Redhat` is commonly used in large, traditional companies (i.e. banks, transportation, airlines, telecoms, large retailers, healthcare)
- `Ubuntu` is popular in startups, SaaS, social networks, small ecommerce stores, or any company that relies heavily on cloud computing. 
- If you're just looking to perssonal use, or use Linux for fun, try out Mint, Debian, Mageia, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, or Slackware. 

## Linux is Linux 
- Linux concepts are universal. Sure, each distro is slightly different, but if you can do something on one distro, you'll most likely be able to figure out how to do it on another distro. 
- This means you can't make the wrong choice! 

## Part 1 RECAP
- **Linux Distro = kernel + software**
