This repo previously stored terminal games produced while I was learning Ruby. I have now updated this repo to be my Book of Notes containing Rails, DevOps, SQL, Ruby, and JS material for reviewing and studying purposes.

If you'd like to contribute by imparting your knowledge on specific concepts and fundamentals, or feel inclined to make a correction to a particular statement, please make a pull request.

I love to learn from others, and welcome contributions!
