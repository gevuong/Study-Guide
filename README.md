This repo previously stored terminal games generated while I was learning Ruby in April 2017. To reduce repo footprint, I updated this repo to be my Repo of Notes, covering topics such as Rails, DevOps, data structures, SQL, Ruby, and JS material for reviewing and studying purposes.

If you'd like to contribute by imparting your knowledge on specific concepts and fundamentals, or feel inclined to make a correction to statements in the docs, please make a pull request, or email. I welcome contributions.
