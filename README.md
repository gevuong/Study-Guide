This repo previously stored terminal games produced while I was beginning to learn Ruby. I have now updated this repo to be my remote notebook of backend material for reviewing and studying purposes. If you'd like to contribute and impart your knowledge on specific concepts and fundamentals, or feel inclined to make a correction to a particular statement, you are welcome to make a pull request.

I love to learn from others, and welcome contributions!
